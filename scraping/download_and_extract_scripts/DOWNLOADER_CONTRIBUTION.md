# GlossAPI Downloader Enhancement - Open Source Contribution

## üéØ Contribution Overview

This contribution represents a comprehensive enhancement to the GlossAPI document collection system, fulfilling the promises made in my original proposal from March 2025. The work addresses the critical challenges identified with PDF downloading from Greek educational and legal repositories.

## üìà From Proposal to Implementation

### Original Challenges (March 2025)
In my initial assessment, I identified significant issues:
- **Kallipos Repository**: Only 225 out of 5,170 PDF files successfully downloaded
- **HTTP 500 errors** when accessing PDFs directly
- **Rate limiting** preventing bulk downloads
- **Inconsistent success rates** across different repositories

### Achieved Solutions (May 2025)
Through systematic development, I have successfully:
- **Kodiko Repository**: **86.95% success rate** (23,086/26,552 files)
- **Greek Language**: **~100% success rate** (complete collection)
- **Cyprus Exams**: Robust downloading with specialized Greek headers
- **Panelladikes**: **78% success rate** with automatic URL fixing
- **Comprehensive Infrastructure**: 15 files including automation and monitoring

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Repository Enhancement Summary

| Repository | Status | Success Rate | Files | Technical Innovation |
|------------|--------|--------------|-------|---------------------|
| **Kodiko** | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** | **86.95%** | **23,086/26,552** | Moderate concurrency, legal doc headers |
| **Greek Language** | ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** | **~100%** | **~50 files** | Greek character handling, PDF validation |
| **Cyprus Exams** | ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** | **Good** | **Variable** | Greek headers, filename sanitization |
| **Panelladikes** | ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** | **78%** | **101/127** | URL fixing, exponential backoff |
| **Kallipos** | ‚ùå **RESEARCHED** | **0%** | **Blocked** | Multiple methods, extended timeouts |

### Code Architecture Evolution

#### Before (Original downloader.py)
```python
# Basic implementation
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(3)
sleep_time = 1
timeout = 60
# No PDF validation
# No site-specific headers
```

#### After (Specialized downloaders)
```python
# Site-optimized implementation
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(1-2)  # Conservative approach
sleep_time = 3-5  # Respectful delays
timeout = 60-120  # Extended for difficult sites

# Advanced features
async def is_pdf(first_bytes):
    return first_bytes.startswith(b'%PDF')

headers = {
    'Accept-Language': 'el-GR,el;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7',
    'Sec-Fetch-Dest': 'document',
    # Modern browser simulation
}
```
