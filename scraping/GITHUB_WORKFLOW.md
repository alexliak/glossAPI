# GitHub Workflow for GlossAPI Contribution

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- âœ… Fork completed: `alexliak/glossAPI`
- âœ… Local clone with development work
- âœ… Feature branch: Currently on `final` branch
- âœ… Code ready: 5 specialized downloaders + documentation
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next**: Create Pull Request and contribute to upstream

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Contribution Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Branch for Contribution
```bash
# Check current status
git status
git branch -a

# Ensure you're on your feature branch
git checkout final

# Update from upstream (if needed)
git remote -v  # Verify you have upstream remote
# If not: git remote add upstream https://github.com/eellak/glossAPI.git

git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master  # Or main branch
```

### Step 2: Create a Clean Commit History
```bash
# Review your commits
git log --oneline -10

# If you need to clean up commits, use interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~5  # Adjust number as needed

# Or create a single comprehensive commit
git reset --soft HEAD~10  # Adjust number to include all your changes
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add specialized downloaders with 86.95% success rate

- Implement 5 site-specific downloaders (Kodiko, Greek Language, Cyprus, Panelladikes, Kallipos)
- Achieve 86.95% success rate for Kodiko (23,086/26,552 files)
- Add comprehensive automation scripts (.sh files) and monitoring tools
- Include Greek language support with proper character encoding
- Implement PDF validation and respectful rate limiting
- Create extensive documentation with performance metrics and usage guides

Resolves challenges from original proposal where only 4.3% success rate was achieved.
This enhancement provides production-ready infrastructure for Greek document collection.

Performance Results:
- Kodiko: 86.95% success rate (23,968/26,552 files)
- Greek Language: ~100% success rate (~50 files)
- Cyprus Exams: Robust with Greek headers
- Panelladikes: 78% success rate with URL fixing
- Total: 23,000+ documents successfully collected

Technical Improvements:
- Site-specific concurrency control (1-2 vs original 3)
- Modern browser simulation with Greek language headers
- Exponential backoff retry strategies
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- PDF content validation preventing invalid downloads

### Step 3: Push to Your Fork
```bash
# Push your feature branch to your fork
git push origin final

# Or if you want to rename the branch for clarity
git checkout -b feature/specialized-downloaders
git push origin feature/specialized-downloaders
```

### Step 4: Create GitHub Issue (Optional but Recommended)
Go to https://github.com/eellak/glossAPI/issues and create a new issue:

**Title**: "Enhancement: Specialized Downloaders for Improved Success Rates"

**Description Template**:
```markdown
## Problem Statement
The current generic downloader has low success rates for certain Greek educational repositories. My initial testing showed only 4.3% success rate (225/5170 files) for Kallipos repository.

## Proposed Solution
I have developed 5 specialized downloaders with site-specific optimizations:

- **Kodiko** (Legal documents): 86.95% success rate (23,086/26,552 files)
- **Greek Language** (Educational): ~100% success rate
- **Cyprus Exams**: Robust with Greek language support
- **Panelladikes**: 78% success rate with URL fixing
- **Kallipos**: Research implementation (blocked by server)

## Implementation Details
- Respectful rate limiting (1-2 concurrent vs original 3)
- Site-specific headers and Greek language support
- PDF validation and error handling
- Comprehensive automation and monitoring infrastructure

## Files to be Added
- 5 specialized downloader scripts
- 5 automation shell scripts
- 5 monitoring scripts
- 6 comprehensive documentation files
- Project-wide CONTRIBUTING.md

## Performance Results
Successfully collected 23,000+ documents for the Greek language corpus.

Would appreciate feedback from maintainers before submitting the Pull Request.
